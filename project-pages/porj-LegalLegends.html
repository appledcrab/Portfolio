                    <h2>My Project Experiences</h2>
                    <p>Going into 2024, I felt that I hadn't done enough or tried enough things. While that was vauge, I stilled in myself that I needed to do more things that Spring semester. That meant participating in clubs more, going to events, and doing more projects.</p>
                    <p>As such, this was the beggining. Global Game Jam was my first hackathon type of event of working under a hard deadline. It was stressful, showing up to the event with no people in mind to work with, but a small group got together after the initial ceremony and we were off. </p>
                    <p>Our game was a 2d pixel art game where you play as a lawyer in a courtroom. The game was a mix of Ace Attorney with a funny LoL reference, where you had to find contradictions in the witness's statements. The game was a bit buggy, but we were able to get a working prototype by the end of the event.</p>

                        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
                        <p>Through this project, I continued to see how much people can do in a short amount of time. I felt that I could really contribute to something and that I could work with a team more closely. </p>
                        <p>I was also surprised with how much art I could make in 36 hours.</p>

                        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
                        <p>After the event was over, we continued until we had a fully voiced game which we then pushed to Itch.io!</p ><p> We enjoyed working on it and while we had tried to get a fully voiced game during the alloted time, we did not reach that goal. We did get most of the characters voiced and got to put in all of 3 characters voices, but removed it before submitting as we couldn't just have a few voiced.</p>
