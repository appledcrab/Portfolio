                    <h2>My Project Experiences</h2>
                    <p>This project was for Aurora Club (now PantherDev) @ GSU. Out of 5 or so different groups that were showing off their different ideas, I went with this group for their interesting idea and I enjoy doing pixel art.</p>
                    <p>My role was mainly to create background assets including making repeating tiles, room assets, and general art thumbnails.</p>
                    <p>It was a great experience to work with a team and see how everyone's different skills came together to create a game. While it could have been better organized, we were all getting used to it, and if we all got together to try again we would have done better.</p>
                    <p>We had weekly meetings to checkup on how everyone was doing, but unfortunately some classes were outweighing the priority for alot of members and we ended up stalling for a bit of time. </p>
                    <p>Overall, having to work with a team and having to create assets for a game was a great experience and I would love to do it again.</p>
