                    <p>This was the second group project for my Mobile App Development Class. I worked with the same person I did before on the Mood Mate app.</p>
                    
                    <p>To speed up the process I looked for more packages that could help. I found a peristent nav bar package and a basic messaging that helped with messaging between users.</p>
                    <p>It was a little more stressful doing this alongside another large group project, but we pushed through. Once it was starting to work, having messages in real time was fun and I tested it with my friend and my phones.</p>

                        <p>Importance of reading through not only the documentation, but also following the methods locally to see exactly what it's doing if the documentation isn't helping.</p>
                        <p>I learned more about the firebase database along with having collections within collections and having to work around them aswell.</p>
                        <p>Creating unique user experiences by having their page shown by the list of people they are following.</p>

                        <p>The idea of revisiting is tempting, but I am not attached enough to spend extra money on it.</p>
                        <p>While working on it, I tried to figure out how to push notifications from in app and outside of app based on if someone posts or the user gets messaged, but from what I saw, it seemed out of reach for the time I had left before the deadline.</p>
                        <p>(if you see notifications mentioned it can get notifications from the firebase cloud messaging, but manually)</p>
                        <p>The visuals of the app is also really basic and could be revisited.</p>
