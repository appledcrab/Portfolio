                    <p>Being about only my second week into working with flutter, dart, and android studio, it was a challenge and I was learning while I was making this project. This was also my first time trying to work with an API in something. Getting over this, I looked at a lot more online resources and both of these were learning curves for sure. Not besides that fact I decided to start doing this noon on Saturday by myself.</p>

                        <p>I also learned more about connecting with a third party api, Edamam</p>

                        <p>I was not happy with how I finished with it and I definitely think about revisit this project.</p><p>I think something that could be keeping me back, besides time, is trying to learn more about working around the API. It was really giving me issues and I don't think I understood the documentation enough. I would be more comfortable revisting it if I had an API that I felt more comfortable with.</p>
