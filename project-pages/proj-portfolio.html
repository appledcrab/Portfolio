                    <h2>My Project Experiences</h2>
                    <p>For my portfolio, I wanted to make a proper showcase of my experience and projects that I have
                        done. Expanding further than my resume, I wanted to make something more colorful, still
                        professional, but showing some of my character. I had more to show than what was on my resume,
                        and I will get that across.</p>
                    <p>The main color for the page is red. Red is my favorite color. That's about the only reason. I
                        enjoy green, but I couldn't do red and green for lack of being reminded of a Christmas tree.</p>
                    <p>I have made a portfolio for class before, but did not enjoy having to include certain aspects of
                        the rubric or how it came out for that matter. (It's main color was green. Surprise).
                        I did learn more about flexbox while doing it and my frsutrations with not getting things to
                        align properly</p>
